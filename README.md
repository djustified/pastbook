### Pastbook web project

# clone the repo from https://github.com/djustified/pastbook.git or git@github.com:djustified/pastbook.git

# run npm install

# run npm start

# This project expects the apis (seperate repo) to be running in port 3200 as mentioned here : https://github.com/djustified/pastbookapi/blob/master/README.md

# The backend project can be clone from https://github.com/djustified/pastbookapi.git or git@github.com:djustified/pastbookapi.git

### TODO // Stuff that I wanted to do but had limited time for

1. Move configuration values to .env variables
2. Use ENUMS for special constants
3. Make use of DTDs using typeScript to interface between API responses and the web
4. Make the readMe and documentation better and informative
5. Code cleanup
6. Attempt to do the array sorting using my own code without the help of array-move-hoc
